This week was special for to start working with Clojure. At this moment is not just Javascript (that we all love). 

We start this newsletter so even if you don't know what to read, you can learn something new without long searching. If you have interesting article or video then post it to channel `#dev-news` on slack. Please add few lines why you like that article if it's possible. It will be helpfull. We will try to read everything that is going to this newsletter, but it's hard to do some work while reading.

Oh, and if you would like to say something to all Vacuum Devs, we will give you space on the start of newsletter posts. (It would be cool if you have something that will help to make our development better.)
